# :bulb: Overview
This is Self Test for the POC which gives the overview of states of all the devices connected to the board i.e the driver settings of I2C bus.

It consists I2C bus or  IÂ²C bus which has the details of devices' name, its chip address, register's address, value, delay, register size and data size. At start there are 3 uart states that are considered, uart state (0x1), uart state (0x2) and uart state (0x4). Then after the devices with its initial detatils are entered manualy (as the ade namely, HDMI ADV7513(U4), HDMI ADV7513(U5), Temperature Sensor (MCP9800A1), Camera Bridge and LED driver. It also takes initial FPGA configuration and the required settings.

Now the devices' states are checked and uart states are assigned to the devices accordingly. For both the HDMI ADV7513, it assigns uart state 0x1 and 0x2 respectively also the initially the I2C Bus assigned to 0x70 so that it selects HDMI encoder and then it points the value to 0x1 and 0x2 of MUX respectively, later it checkes if the the address of data and the expected is same or not and shows "Pass" or "Fail" correspondingly. For Temperature Sensor, Camera Bridge and LED Driver, the uart states assigned is 0x4. For Temperature Sensor, it reads the value and assigns new value to Temperature Sensor and checks if the value is neither 0x00 nor 0xFF, it declares it as "Pass" otherwise "Fail". 

After the present state of all the devices are recorded, uart initializes USB with baud rate 115200
