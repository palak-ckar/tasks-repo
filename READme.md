# :bulb: Overview
This is Self Test for the POC which gives the overview of states of all the devices connected to the board i.e the driver settings of I2C bus.

It consists I2C bus or  IÂ²C bus which has the details of devices' name, its chip address, register's address, value, delay, register size and data size. At start there are 3 uart states that are considered, uart state (0x1), uart state (0x2) and uart state (0x4). Then after the devices with its initial detatils are entered manualy (as the ade namely, HDMI ADV7513(U4), HDMI ADV7513(U5), Temperature Sensor (MCP9800A1), Camera Bridge and LED driver. It also takes initial FPGA configuration and the required settings.

Now the devices' states are checked and altered details accordingly and
